# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022)

This project attempts to give you the deal type based on the interior design, comfort, performance, value for money, exterior styling, reliablility, and min/max MPG's. 

An example use case would be when you are trying to decide on a car but don't want name and branding to interfere with which car is *actually* better in terms of the deal.
